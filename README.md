Dish Smith 2013
=========

For my wife, Becky :-)

DishSmith is a meal planner created at [HACT 2013](http://hact.org.au).

## What is?

DishSmith lets you organise your life for eating. It is a meal planner based on the premise that eating right requires either **passion** or **planning**.

You add your favourite Dishes and Ingredients needed for those dishes. DishSmith will *pepper* these dishes in to a weekly timetable.

You can even print a shopping list to be used at the beginning of each week.

## Made in Australia

DishSmith is made using [October CMS](http://octobercms.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
